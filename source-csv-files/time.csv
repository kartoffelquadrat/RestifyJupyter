Blue-Fox, 931, 2167, 3602, 5835,True,True,Watches excerpts of screencast again rather than following textual instructions.,Forgets to refresh pom.xml. Copies any snippets of code of instructions anywhere trial and error. Ignores zoo restlauncher in pom xml for a long time. Does not remove tests for long time. Did not ever refresh pom xml in IDE
Blue-Koala, 992, 1925, 3043, 5445,True,True,TC crash. watched parts of screencast again during task,Forgot pom launcher config until almost end
Blue-Raccoon, 924, 1698, 2757, 5227,True,True,All good.,Watches parts of video instructions again durig task solving. Stopped with autowire exception and noted: no time to figure it out on screen. Recommenced task later. Actually figured it out. Had issue with running app twice and port being blocked. Figured it out with netstat.
Blue-Squid, 1002,1811, 2892, 4205,True,True,TC crash. Watched parts of instruction video again. Read xox javadoc to figure out ambigous mapping instructions later described as ambiguous,Struggles with IDE pom refresh. Hesitates when IDE does not recognize plugin versions. Struggles with PostConstruct
Blue-Turtle,755,637,1825,926,False,False,Did not follow instructions order. Interleaved screencast and task. Plays screencast partially in 2x speed. Ends up removing half of what was already modelled to start over. Uses split view in Vertical mode which is not shown in video. Maps root GET to getInstance method. Unable to naviagte in touchcore since screencast not watched. Opens and closes random menues.Model parameters do not carry names this could be an outdated version of xox unclear why. Hits trafo button with incplete mappings and when presetnted with error message adds random mappings.,"Does not watch complete explanation screencast. Starts working on task while watching video. Not all RESTification tasks captured on video, stops after launcher creation."
Blue-Unicorn,917,2242,2096,3789,True,True,Starts with zoo. Only continues with xox after zoo is fully imitated. Xox task starts at 31:32 goes until end 52:39.,In contrast to assisted task directly proceeds to bookstore. Watches short excerpts of screencast again when stuck. Struggles at first with post processing.
Blue-Zebra,1043,1782,2276,3738,True,True,Imitates zoo instructions on zoo while watching screencast. Forgets to set launcher class in pom. Stuck at refresh of pom fil ein IDE. Does not read troubleshoot section. Only adds @restcontroller at end probably forgotten. Struggles with autowiring.Searches again on StackOverflow rather than reading instructions or troubleshoot section. Gives up after about 90 minutes without solving autowiring issue.,Solves tasks with IDE eclipse / ignores instructions for IntelliJ. Works on Zoo sample sources while watching video. Windows firewall first blocks access to developped rest backend popup. Access not explicitly allowed. Watches screecast at accelerated speed.
Green-Fox,889,2154,1986,3653,True,False,Does not finish watching instructions. Starts TC to work on zoo before screencast is finished. TC crashes while modelling Rest Tree. Zaps through video instructions seemingly randomly. Later goes back to individual places when stuck.,Does not finish instructions / zoo tests before opening bookstore. Starts working on pom changes then goes back to video instructions. Jumps agressively back and forth between video illustrations and actual task. Submission can not reflect end state at video (not compiling)
Green-Koala,902,2066,647,2651,True,True,TC seems to crash after successful weaving and code generation. Probably not relevant.,Uses Eclipse despite instructions telling to use IntelliJ. Runs into bean creation error because construtor accesses autowired field. Solved it by calling critical method with postconstruct instead.
Green-Raccoon,406,2258,3290,5069,True,True,"Tries to use TouchCORE without watching screencast and only after 20 minutes of trial and error goes back to start of instructions to watch screencast. Only watches some minutes of screencast and then tries to continue with task again before screencast finished. Gets stuck again. Tries to modify ResTL model in splitview meant only for mapping. Also tries to map path parameters of resources that do not contain the corresponding dynamic path parameter in resource path. Consults manually creates solution source code of first task for some minutes. Unclear why. Uses DOS commands on UNIX command line. Ends up jumping back and forth, never finishes video instructions.",Forgets at first to update launcher class in pom. Forgets at first to refresh maven settings in IntelliJ. Solves both.
Green-Squid,462,3101,3260,7397,True,False,"Starts TouchCORE before reading any instructions or watching screencast. Then opens screencast and skips first three minutes. Jumps frenetically back and forth, watches only snippets of some seconds, jumps randomly back and forth in video. Keeps dragginf on resource, does not read instructions or watch examples that tell how to extend resource tree by dragging below box. Modifies textual decription by noting text of target method in there rather than just draing the line between REST endpoint and method. At some point even opens code source in intelliJ to inspect Xox internals, although models and javadoc are provided. Parameters do not show correct names in model, unclear why. Possibly outdated build of xox.","Jumps back and forth in mini steps of just some seconds between video instructinos and his own task. Very inefficient and does nit finish the task in over two hours 30 minutes. 3:30min pause in screencast at about 1h16 where not sure if walked awqay or just all of a sudden looking very concentrated at apused video. Cannot distinguish from information I have. Counting it as regular video watch time. Access on autowired field in constrcutor, benas cannot be constructed. Does not use PostConstruct annotation. Gives up."
Green-Turtle,892,2282,2332,4010,True,True,All good.,Opens all three code directories as bundles projects in intellij before having finished video instructions. Changes IDE settings that were meant for troubleshoot although no need.
Green-Unicorn,1145,1966,1955,7931,False,False,Opens TouchCORE only seconds after start of screencast and tries to imitate steps while watching video. Then gives up and jumps back and forth between imitation of zoo restification - which was not the task - and video instructions. Generates code but it is not runnablke because manual restified app is still running on same port.,"Works on Zoo while watching video, then jumps to Bookstore and refactores is parallel to watching video. Hectic jumpick back and fiirth between task and instructions. Struggles with autowiring, never finishes video instructions and instead adds generic catch blocks to suppress in attempt to suppress spring bean creation exception."
Green-Zebra,1384,2924,2357,8615,True,True,Tries parts of screencast while watching on zoo models. inspects Xox source code while mapping on parameters. Possibly because parameter names are not displayed in splitview.,Tries some maven for zoo while watching screencast. Opens Zoo in intelliJ while watching screencast but does not actually refactor it yet. Follows screencast to end until starting manual refactoring of bookstore.
Red-Fox,2615,2745,3682,2488,True,False,Struggles with setting of JVM version for touchcore before starting task. Should have been checked in preliminaries. Replicates full zoo example with touchcore before starting own task. Video stops before any resource verified. Types wrong root url and then gives up.,Does not finish screencast or zoo replications before starting to work on xox task. Interleaved. Aggressively jumps back and forth for mini parts of task. Watches only some seconds then replicates them. Forgets plugins tag for a long time and ignores IDE warnings. Creates a textual version of ResTL in text editor before translating it to annotations for methods. Uses camel case notation for resources and needs several tries to test them.
Red-Koala,1153,1690,2311,1265,True,True,"Tries out entire Zoo example live, while following TouchCORE instructions.",Manually refactors Xox project while watching screencast. Afressive jumping back and forth between video instrucitons and manual own task solving in mini steps.
Red-Raccoon,959,3256,1251,2161,False,True,All good.,"Does not finish task. Gives up after a total time of about 80 minutes. Is ok, spend requested minimum amount of time on solving. Lost a lot of time by jumping back and forth between instructions and solving. Does not finish instructions before starting and then gets lost in the process. Tries to solve task with eclipse although all instructions are written for IntelliJ and IntelliJ is likewise the recommended IDE. Does not seem to know about code auto formatting because they spend a lot of time manually indenting code. Confuses GetMapping with a a getter for all mappings and keeps typing GetMappings for a significant time. Does not finish video or read instructions, stops video every 5 seconds to replicate steps on zoo sample app. After one hour notices that this was not the task and finally starts working on xox."
Red-Squid,1210,2636,2713,1256,True,True,"Replicates TC screencast on zoo while watching instructions. Jumps back and forth between instructions and trying things out for zoo. This si why the tcinstructions take longer. Also takes time to tweak touchcore resolution during instruction video, which was supposed to be done as preliminaries. (Excluded from time measurement). When workin on own task (BS) does at first not open the right persepctive and attempts to model BookStore REST tree as feature model - happens because they skip most of the instructions and directly scroll to the bookstore REST interface description. Very fast once in the right touchcore perspective.","At first does not watch instructinos and jumps direclty to task descriptions. OpensIDE before having watched instruction video. Since instructions exemplify on zoo, first replicates zoo. Apparently did not read that they have to work on a different application. Eventually starts reading from top and opens screencast. Does not watch screencast to end but directly replicates steps on zoo. Replicates even the steps that are only shown for troubleshooting, eg IDE cache invalidation. Does not follow instrucitons. Enters their actual name instead of pseudonym sent by email. Jumps back and forth in seconds interval between manual zoo restify instructions and manual task solving (of Zoo, not of xox!). Forgot parent clause in pom.xml while replicating steps on zoo. Keeps reloading entire project into IntelliJ rather than comparing their pom.xml to the provided snippet or to the instructions. Eventually proceeds in video, ignoring errors in pom.xml. Video stalls at some point for 10 minutes. Absolutely nothing happens. Assuming this is AFK, and excluded from video time measurement). Eventually fixes missing parent statement by copying solution from zoo solution branch on git. While working on xox first stuck because forgets to set rest launcher in pom.xml."
Red-Turtle,911,1296,2794,2502,True,True,"At first stuck in splitview because they try to create the ResTL model from the splitview, but the split view in default state only allows mappings. Afterwards pretty straightforward. Uses API doc to identify desired bookstore target method.","Does not watch complete screencast first. Jumps back to textual instructions after 2 minutes, then proceeds in interleaved mode where short parts of screencast are watched, followed by working on own Xox task. Seems to have problems with spring bean container, watches the corresponding part of video 3-4 times. During task solving also struggles a lot with bean container and autowired. Launch first fails becaus they forgot to update the launcher class in pom.xml"
Red-Unicorn,1058,2188,2568,2088,True,True,"Struggles a bit with creation of subresources. Keeps trying to drag starting on top level resource, no below, for about 2 minutes. No other issues.",Googles some details of spring boot annotation URL syntax while watching screencast. Otherwise very linear.
Red-Zebra,1591,2046,1536,1167,True,True,"Replicates full zoo after having watched TC screencast. First struggles with maven commands, launching of jar. First stuck in split view. Tries to model ResTL while in splitview. While connecting lines, the amount of lines covering resource endpoints that are still to map is indeed an issue. Restified bookstore seems to print exceptions to console, although tested behaviour by participant is correct.",First attempts to start xox with green launcher triangles that are not linked to maven. (Displayed by intelliJ next to main method) Edits pom.xml with a lot of confidence. Probably knows what they are doing.
