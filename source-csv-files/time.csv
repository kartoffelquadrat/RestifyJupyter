Blue-Fox, 931, 2167, 3602, 5835,True,True,Watches excerpts of screencast again rather than following textual instructions.,Forgets to refresh pom.xml. Copies any snippets of code of instructions anywhere trial and error. Ignores zoo restlauncher in pom xml for a long time. Does not remove tests for long time. Did not ever refresh pom xml in IDE
Blue-Koala, 992, 1925, 3043, 5445,True,True,TC crash. watched parts of screencast again during task,Forgot pom launcher config until almost end
Blue-Raccoon, 924, 1698, 2757, 5227,True,True,All good.,Watches parts of video instructions again durig task solving. Stopped with autowire exception and noted: no time to figure it out on screen. Recommenced task later. Actually figured it out. Had issue with running app twice and port being blocked. Figured it out with netstat.
Blue-Squid, 1002,1811, 2892, 4205,True,True,TC crash. Watched parts of instruction video again. Read xox javadoc to figure out ambigous mapping instructions later described as ambiguous,Struggles with IDE pom refresh. Hesitates when IDE does not recognize plugin versions. Struggles with PostConstruct
Blue-Turtle,755,637,1825,926,False,False,Did not follow instructions order. Interleaved screencast and task. Plays screencast partially in 2x speed. Ends up removing half of what was already modelled to start over. Uses split view in Vertical mode which is not shown in video. Maps root GET to getInstance method. Unable to naviagte in touchcore since screencast not watched. Opens and closes random menues.Model parameters do not carry names this could be an outdated version of xox unclear why. Hits trafo button with incplete mappings and when presetnted with error message adds random mappings.,"Does not watch complete explanation screencast. Starts working on task while watching video. Not all RESTification tasks captured on video, stops after launcher creation."
Blue-Unicorn,917,2242,2096,3789,True,True,Starts with zoo. Only continues with xox after zoo is fully imitated. Xox task starts at 31:32 goes until end 52:39.,In contrast to assisted task directly proceeds to bookstore. Watches short excerpts of screencast again when stuck. Struggles at first with post processing.
Blue-Zebra,1043,1782,2276,3738,True,True,Imitates zoo instructions on zoo while watching screencast. Forgets to set launcher class in pom. Stuck at refresh of pom fil ein IDE. Does not read troubleshoot section. Only adds @restcontroller at end probably forgotten. Struggles with autowiring.Searches again on StackOverflow rather than reading instructions or troubleshoot section. Gives up after about 90 minutes without solving autowiring issue.,Solves tasks with IDE eclipse / ignores instructions for IntelliJ. Works on Zoo sample sources while watching video. Windows firewall first blocks access to developped rest backend popup. Access not explicitly allowed. Watches screecast at accelerated speed.
Green-Fox,889,2154,1986,3653,True,False,Does not finish watching instructions. Starts TC to work on zoo before screencast is finished. TC crashes while modelling Rest Tree. Zaps through video instructions seemingly randomly. Later goes back to individual places when stuck.,Does not finish instructions / zoo tests before opening bookstore. Starts working on pom changes then goes back to video instructions. Jumps agressively back and forth between video illustrations and actual task. Submission can not reflect end state at video (not compiling)
Green-Koala,902,2066,647,2651,True,True,TC seems to crash after successful weaving and code generation. Probably not relevant.,Uses Eclipse despite instructions telling to use IntelliJ. Runs into bean creation error because construtor accesses autowired field. Solved it by calling critical method with postconstruct instead.
Green-Raccoon,406,2258,3290,5069,True,True,"Tries to use TouchCORE without watching screencast and only after 20 minutes of trial and error goes back to start of instructions to watch screencast. Only watches some minutes of screencast and then tries to continue with task again before screencast finished. Gets stuck again. Tries to modify ResTL model in splitview meant only for mapping. Also tries to map path parameters of resources that do not contain the corresponding dynamic path parameter in resource path. Consults manually creates solution source code of first task for some minutes. Unclear why. Uses DOS commands on UNIX command line. Ends up jumping back and forth, never finishes video instructions.",Forgets at first to update launcher class in pom. Forgets at first to refresh maven settings in IntelliJ. Solves both.
Green-Squid,462,3101,3260,7397,True,False,"Starts TouchCORE before reading any instructions or watching screencast. Then opens screencast and skips first three minutes. Jumps frenetically back and forth, watches only snippets of some seconds, jumps randomly back and forth in video. Keeps dragginf on resource, does not read instructions or watch examples that tell how to extend resource tree by dragging below box. Modifies textual decription by noting text of target method in there rather than just draing the line between REST endpoint and method. At some point even opens code source in intelliJ to inspect Xox internals, although models and javadoc are provided. Parameters do not show correct names in model, unclear why. Possibly outdated build of xox.","Jumps back and forth in mini steps of just some seconds between video instructinos and his own task. Very inefficient and does nit finish the task in over two hours 30 minutes. 3:30min pause in screencast at about 1h16 where not sure if walked awqay or just all of a sudden looking very concentrated at apused video. Cannot distinguish from information I have. Counting it as regular video watch time. Access on autowired field in constrcutor, benas cannot be constructed. Does not use PostConstruct annotation. Gives up."
Green-Turtle,892,2282,2332,4010,True,True,All good.,Opens all three code directories as bundles projects in intellij before having finished video instructions. Changes IDE settings that were meant for troubleshoot although no need.
Green-Unicorn,1145,1966,1955,7931,False,False,Opens TouchCORE only seconds after start of screencast and tries to imitate steps while watching video. Then gives up and jumps back and forth between imitation of zoo restification - which was not the task - and video instructions. Generates code but it is not runnablke because manual restified app is still running on same port.,"Works on Zoo while watching video, then jumps to Bookstore and refactores is parallel to watching video. Hectic jumpick back and fiirth between task and instructions. Struggles with autowiring, never finishes video instructions and instead adds generic catch blocks to suppress in attempt to suppress spring bean creation exception."
Green-Zebra,1384,2924,2357,8615,True,True,Tries parts of screencast while watching on zoo models. inspects Xox source code while mapping on parameters. Possibly because parameter names are not displayed in splitview.,Tries some maven for zoo while watching screencast. Opens Zoo in intelliJ while watching screencast but does not actually refactor it yet. Follows screencast to end until starting manual refactoring of bookstore.
Red-Fox,2615,2745,3682,2488,True,False,Struggles with setting of JVM version for touchcore before starting task. Should have been checked in preliminaries. Replicates full zoo example with touchcore before starting own task. Video stops before any resource verified. Types wrong root url and then gives up.,Does not finish screencast or zoo replications before starting to work on xox task. Interleaved. Aggressively jumps back and forth for mini parts of task. Watches only some seconds then replicates them. Forgets plugins tag for a long time and ignores IDE warnings. Creates a textual version of ResTL in text editor before translating it to annotations for methods. Uses camel case notation for resources and needs several tries to test them.
