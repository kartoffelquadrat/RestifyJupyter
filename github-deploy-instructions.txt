Github does not actually run the notebook, but it can pretty format the outcome of the last full execution.
Do do so...

 * Run the validator. Ensure Jupyter has no corrupted cells.
 * Stop the notebook in the bottom jupyter tab
 * Re run all cells with the double flash (green triangle), ipnyb file opened in pycharm
 * Make a new commit
 * Visit the [notebook page](https://github.com/m5c/RestifyJupyter/blob/master/Restify.ipynb)
