    "\n",
    "Goal of the experiment is the comparison of refactoring methodologies. To eliminate learning effects we asked participants to apply the two methodologies on different applications. Eliminating potential bias by task and application order resulted in a participant repartition into four control groups.\n",

    "#### Heuristic Search for MiniMax\n",
    "We ran a heuristic balancing algorithm to obtain control groups with high comparability in regards to their average score per skill. The algorithm searched for the participant distribution with lowest difference in skill differences per pair of team. Specifically, on every iteration we used the highest score difference on the same skill for any pair of control groups as quality metric. The original partitions were highly comparable: For every tested partition, we computed the highest difference for skill scores between any pair of teams. Goal was to minimize the value as far as possible, resulting in control groups that are highly comparable in any skill. We called this goal the search for the *MiniMax*. The value obtained through our heuristic for the originally recruited population was as low as ```0.6```, that means no matter what skill and pair of groups compared, the average difference in skill was guaranteed to be equal or lower to ```0.6```.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Droppers\n",
    "Unfortunately participants dropped out, even after having committed to a task. At this point we were able to hire replacements, however it was impossible to re-generate a fully optimized new control group repartition. At this point we had already received the first test results and since due to learning effects the study can not be run twice by the same participant, we had to reduce optimizations to a brute force testing of all permutations of dropped out participants and potential replacements. This adjustment had to be repeated three times, since participants kept dropping out, even after deadline extensions and reassured intent of participation.  \n",
    "Yet finally we were able to conclude the study with a population of 28 participants. Although comparability is not as optimal as in the original distribution, we were lucky enough to have ended up with somewhat comparable control groups.\n",
