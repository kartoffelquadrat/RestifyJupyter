    "# RESTify Controled Experiment Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Mining data gathered during the [RESTify Experiment](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~mschie3/recruitment/) for correlations and insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1 - Representative population and fair group partition\n",
    "\n",
    "Even before we begin extracting any insights from collected observations, we demonstrate that out test population was representative. Likewise we demonstrate how the generated partition forms comparable control groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Test population\n",
    "\n",
    "We recruited 28 software engineers from various backgrounds and diverse preliminary skills regarding the experiment tasks. In a preliminary recruitment procedure participants were [asked to provide a self evaluation of their skills](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~mschie3/recruitment/self-assessment.txt), where 1 signifiees no and 5 signifies expert knowledge.  \n",
    "The outcome of the recruited population is depicted below:  \n",

    "\n",
    "### Control groups\n",
    "\n",
    "Add snippets from partitioner here...\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2 - Fusing the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Thorughout the expriment we measured different metrics per participant. Those are stored in seperate CSV files. Some of them were auto-generated by additional scripts, some were created by hand.  \n",
    "In a first step we are going to fuse all individual CSV files, using the *pariticpant codename* as key. The codename consists of a colour and an animal.\n",
    "\n",
    " > We used a total of 4 control groups, *Red*, *Green*, *Blue*, *Yellow*, each starring 7 participants. This setup was chosen to reduce learning effects.\n",
    " \n",
    " The outcome of below cell is a new file: ```restify.csv```.  \n",
    " This file lists all data we ever process in the following, indexed by *participant codename*."
